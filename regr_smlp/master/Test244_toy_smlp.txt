smlp_logger - INFO - Q: Who developed SMLP?

smlp_logger - INFO - Top 3 retrieved passages for this question

smlp_logger - INFO - [1] SMLP was developed by franz, zurab and konstantin.

smlp_logger - INFO - [2] SMLP manual is available at Git Hub. 

smlp_logger - INFO - [3] SMLP is an open source model exploration tool.

smlp_logger - INFO - Answer: <think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who developed the SMLP tool. The question is asking for the developer's name or team. Looking at the context provided, it says that SMLP was developed by three people: Franz, Zurab, and Konstantin. So, each of them contributed to its development.

I should make sure I'm not missing anything else in the context. The manual is available on Git Hub, but that's more about how it's accessed rather than who developed it. SMLP being an open-source tool also doesn't change who created it; it just means it's freely available for others to use and contribute.

So, putting it all together, the developers are Franz, Zurab, and Konstantin. I don't see any other names mentioned here.
</think>

Franz, Zurab, and Konstantin developed SMLP.
