smlp_logger - INFO - Answer: <think>
Okay, let's see what the user is asking for here. They provided a question about who developed SMLP and a specific context that says SMLP was developed by Franz, Zurich, and Konstantin. My task is to answer this in bullet points without any extra commentary or filler text.

First, I need to understand the query clearly. The user wants the answer based solely on the provided context. So, I don't have access to external information beyond what's given here.

Looking at the context, it explicitly states that SMLP was developed by three individuals: Franz, Zurich, and Konstantin. Each of these names is mentioned directly in the text. The manual is linked to Git Hub for those interested, but that doesn't affect who developed SMLP itself.

Since the context clearly lists the developers' names, I can confidently answer based on this information without any additional assumptions or guesses.
</think>

- Franz, Zurich, and Konstantin were the developers of SMLP.
