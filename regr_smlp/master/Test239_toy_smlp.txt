smlp_logger - INFO - Q: Who developed SMLP?

smlp_logger - INFO - Top 3 retrieved passages for this question

smlp_logger - INFO - [1] SMLP was developed by Franz, Zurab and Konstantin.  
SMLP tool paper is published in CAV 2025 conference.  
SMLP manual is available at Git Hub.

smlp_logger - INFO - Answer: <think>
Alright, so I need to figure out who developed SMLP based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.

The first sentence says, "SMLP was developed by Franz, Zurab and Konstantin." That seems straightforwardâ€”three people are mentioned as developers of the tool. Then there's information about a paper published in CAV 2025 and that the manual is available on Git Hub. But these seem like general details about SMLP, not its developer.

The question is asking who developed SMLP specifically. Since the context only mentions three people as contributors but doesn't specify who developed the tool itself, I can't determine which of them was the original developer. The information provided isn't relevant to identifying the developers of SMLP.
</think>

Franz, Zurab, and Konstantin were the three developers of SMLP.
