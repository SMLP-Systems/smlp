smlp_logger - INFO - Q: Who developed SMLP?

smlp_logger - INFO - Top 3 retrieved passages for this question

smlp_logger - INFO - [1] SMLP was developed by franz, zurab and konstantin.

smlp_logger - INFO - [2] SMLP manual is available at Git Hub.

smlp_logger - INFO - [3] SMLP is an open source model exploration tool.

smlp_logger - INFO - Answer: <think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who developed SMLP. The user provided a context that says SMLP was developed by Franz, Zurich, and Konstantin. That's the information they gave. The question is straightforward: who developed it? 

I should break this down. The context mentions three names: Franz, Zurich, and Konstantin. Each of them likely contributed to the development of SMLP in some way. So, putting that together, I can confidently say that each of these individuals was involved in creating SMLP.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything else here. The context doesn't mention any other people or projects related to SMLP, so I don't need to worry about additional contributors. It's purely based on the information given in the provided text.

Therefore, the answer should list all three names as the developers of SMLP.

- Franz  
- Zurich  
- Konstantin
