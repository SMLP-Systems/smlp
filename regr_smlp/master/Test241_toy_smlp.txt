smlp_logger - INFO - Q: Who developed SMLP?

smlp_logger - INFO - Top 3 retrieved passages for this question

smlp_logger - INFO - [1] SMLP was developed by franz, zurab and konstantin.

smlp_logger - INFO - [2] SMLP manual is available at Git Hub.

smlp_logger - INFO - [3] SMLP is an open source model exploration tool.

smlp_logger - INFO - Answer: <think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who developed SMLP. The question is straightforward: "Who developed SMLP?" And the context provided says that SMLP was developed by Franz, Zurab, and Konstantin.

First, let me read through the context again to make sure I understand it correctly. It mentions that SMLP was developed by these three individuals: Franz, Zurab, and Konstantin. There's also a mention of the SMLP manual being available on Git Hub and that SMLP is an open-source tool.

I don't see any other information about who developed it besides the names listed. So, based solely on the context given, I can conclude that the developers are Franz, Zurab, and Konstantin.
