# Main effects are those that occur between an independent variable and a dependent response variable.

                    'without needing to use a complete three-level factorial experiment. ' +
                    'The design consists of three distinct sets of experimental runs: ' +

                    '    the values used in the factorial portion. This point is often replicated in order to ' +
                    '    improve the precision of the experiment; ' +
                    ' *  A set of axial points, experimental runs identical to the centre points except for one factor, ' +
                    '    which will take on values both below and above the median of the two factorial levels, and ' +
                    '    typically both outside their range. All factors are varied in this way. ' +
                    'Parameters: ' +
                    ' * factor_level_ranges: dictionary of factors and ranges. Only min and max values of the range ' +

                    '    following values: "orthogonal", or "o", and "rotatable", or "r" [default "o"] ' +
                    ' * face: The relation between the start points and the corner (factorial) points. There are three ' +

                    '      are truly limits, the CCI design uses the factors settings as the star points and creates a ' +
