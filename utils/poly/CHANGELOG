2022-11-15 poly-v0.6.0

 * code simplification and cleanup
 * documentation of trace format and rationale behind it in readme
 * move {id_theta => all_eq}() to public API
 * add u, trace showing final range and contained info and c,/d, trace records
 * generalize search range for GearOpt and add option -T THRESHS
 * relax check on -Cbnds-dom for -r: input bounds empty -> fine
 * ksmt-0.1.7 not supported (missing (get-model)), next version will be
 * simplify and add check for Match() signature
 * fix infix parser: x-y+z was parsed as x-(y+z)

2022-11-08 poly-v0.5.0

 * fix for gmpxx build
 * derivative() returns null for (ite c y n) with var in free vars of c
 * simplify check in critical points
 * cleanup critical points output
 * critical points uses NNF of formula
 * separate critical points solver from ival-solver + more output
 * do not assume real inputs from lists + sanitize behaviour of -r
 * add ordering on terms and formulas
 * document operations on expr2 terms and formulas some more
 * add interval-evaluation API
 * use interval approximation when -R is not given in optimization mode
 * remove outdated guard claiming the interval-solver is not supported for optimization - it is
 * update -R in help message / usage in readme
 * update -d DELTA desc in usage info
 * remove unused Makefiles
 * support -Dstatic=true
 * allow lhs to refer to named output symbols + use that for NNs
 * add -C bnds-dom + check finiteness of ival evaluation
 * more sanitization of -R LO,HI inputs

2022-11-02 poly-v0.4.0

 * update usage in readme
 * compat with clang>=11, gcc>=11
 * simplify gear formula using "target" = (beta /\ f >= T)
 * switch to kay::dbl::ival, add SUBDIVS param to -i, do not install SIGINT handler
 * unconditionally include ival-solver
 * ival-solver supports ite2
 * add license headers to ival-solver
 * ival-solver cleanup
 * feed maybes from ival to next solver
 * add simplify() on form2 and term2 + add derivative() on term2
 * WIP: ival computes #critical points for simple problems
 * add meson configure option -Dasserts=(true|false)
 * missing case in simplify()
 * add critical-points search after ival-solver

2022-11-02 poly-v0.3.0

 * prepare making z3-solver optional
 * make z3-solver optional
 * fix typo in help message
 * cleanup includes
 * add first version of an interval solver
 * do not capture stderr of external solvers
 * ival-solver: eval combinations separately
 * comment ival-solver code
 * sequence ival- and other solvers
 * sanitize solver::add() API + ival-solver sub-divides once on MAYBE
 * include sub-division log messages

2022-10-27 poly-v0.2.0

 * add -Dstatic=(true|false) meson option
 * add -V for version info
 * add support for Not() for ALPHA, BETA
 * add support for -e ETA
 * update usage in readme
 * add some detail in build instructions
 * initial support for external solver
 * fix parsing model of ext-solver + add -I INC-CMD
 * ext-solver prints (first) error in check()
 * cleanup ext-solver model parsing
 * run ext-solver in ${SHELL:-sh} instead of sh
 * perform ood-check using ext-solver if specified
 * include exit-code description in help message

2022-10-24 poly-v0.1.0

 * initial release
