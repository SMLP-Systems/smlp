The following functionality, usually split into a .hh API and a .cc
implementation file is here:

- expr: symbolic expressions suitable to store polynomials exported from the
        JMP software
- expr2: a variation on expr that replaces function calls with ite-s and is more
         suitable for symbolic solving + logical formulas
- infix, prefix: parsers for text files containing a string representation of
                 polynomials
- domain: a representation of commonly used domains of the variables
- dump-smt2: methods to export expr2, formulas and domain constraints to
             SMT-LIB2
- z3-solver: an abstraction of the Z3 API, allowing to put formulas, expr2 and
             domain constraints into the Z3 solver
- poly: parsing polynomial expressions from JMP
- smlp.cc: the main program
